#HELP FOR NOOBIES!!! GITHUB HINT
git add <file>/<folder>/* - mark file/folder that send to repo
git commit -m "text" - commit the file
git push - upload to repo
git commit -am "text" - commit deleted file
git status - useful to check which files you marked
Have some troubles with uploading? Use repo_init.exe from repo (64 bit only, in Russian)
